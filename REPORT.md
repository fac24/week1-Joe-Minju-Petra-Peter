# Report Introduction: 💬 🦸

:purple_heart: The initial idea was to create a microblogging web application that would give the user the option of typing their name and message, submitting this message, which leads in the name and message poping up below. :thought_balloon:

As a team we came up with a comic style theme that came across very interactive with colour and styling. Petra who was UX Lead took part in creating the styling and the result was simply breathtaking. :right_anger_bubble: Speech bubbles popping from left to right made a narrative each time a user submitted their message. :boom:

#### As a team we implemented what we learnt from workshops during the week which was installing express, node.js, Cypress for testing and learning about heroku for deployment. :space_invader:

# User Stories:

### Core feature:
   - 🧑‍💻 As a blogger, I would like to show my thoughts and honest opinions to ensure that people may read them when they visit the site.
   - 🧵 As a particularly curious user, I would search and read through many thread messages. 
   - 📶 All code will only work from the server itself.
   - 💻 HTML is imbedded inside node.js.
   - 🕸 A page that contains a form so that users may wish to submit a pop up speech bubble message.
   - 🎨 Placed CSS Styling as a static asset.
   - 🤖 Cypress testing for different functionality server paths.
