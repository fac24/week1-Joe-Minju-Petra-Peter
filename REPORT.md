# Report Introduction: ðŸ’¬ ðŸ¦¸

:purple_heart: The initial idea was to create a microblogging web application that would give the user the option of typing their name and message, submitting this message, which leads in the name and message poping up below. :thought_balloon:

As a team we came up with a comic style theme that came across very interactive with colour and styling. Petra who was UX Lead took part in creating the styling and the result was simply breathtaking. :right_anger_bubble: Speech bubbles popping from left to right made a sense of narrative each time a user submitted their message. :boom:

#### As a team we implemented what we learn't from workshops during the week which was installing express, node.js, Cypress for testing and learning about heroku for deployment. :space_invader:
